	Otrzymane wyniki pomiarow wydajnosci funkcji, ktore wykorzystuja funkcje systemowe do obslugi 
plikow oraz dla porownania funkcje biblioteczne do obslugi plikow, wskazuja na to, ze wydajniejsza obsluga
plikow jest bardziej prawdopodobna do osiagniecia z wykorzystaniem funkcji systemowych. Czasy systemowe
i czasy uzytkownika wykorzystane przez funkcje systemowe sa odpowiednio mniejsze.
